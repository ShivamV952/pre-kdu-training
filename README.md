👋 About Me
Hey there! I'm Shivam a problem-solver, and lifelong learner currently studying at IIIT Lucknow.

🌱 I’m constantly exploring the world of backend development, with a keen interest in building scalable and robust applications.
💡 My favorite data structure? Trees—because growth is the ultimate goal, both in code and in life! 🌳
🛠️ I’ve worked on projects using Supabase as the backend, diving deep into PostgreSQL to understand how things work behind the scenes.
🚀 I'm preparing for my journey into the professional world, honing my skills to make a meaningful impact.
🎯 My goal? To make life easier and happier for the people I care about—especially my parents and sister.
